# Centered Gallery with Descriptions

## Overview
This project is a web-based virtual gallery called **Virtual Reality Tour**. It features an immersive and interactive interface designed to captivate users with high-quality visuals and engaging descriptions. Each image is centered for focus, with thoughtful descriptions adding depth to the viewing experience. Visitors can click on images to explore more details about them on dedicated pages.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Layout**: A scrollable gallery with centered images and descriptions.
- **Image Descriptions**: Each image is accompanied by a title and a detailed description for context.
- **Interactive Links**: Clickable images redirect users to dedicated pages for further exploration.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using external CSS.

## Project Structure
### HTML
- **Header**: Includes the gallery's title.
- **Description Card**: A welcome section introducing the Virtual Reality Tour.
- **Gallery Section**: Displays a series of images with descriptions.

### CSS
An external stylesheet (`styles.css`) is used to enhance visual aesthetics and ensure responsiveness.

### Images
- Images are stored in the root directory or an appropriate subfolder (e.g., `img1.jpg`, `img2.jpg`).
- Each image links to a separate HTML page (e.g., `photo1.html`, `photo2.html`) for additional details.
